# [DiscordDJ](http://guichaguri.github.io/DiscordDJ/)
Discord DJ Bot. Let you play music in your server. Inspired by PlugDJ

## This is a Work-in-Progress project

We have some [development builds](https://github.com/Guichaguri/DiscordDJ/releases), expect broken stuff.
Some features (not all of them):

* Play a playlist file (pls, m3u)
* Play a playlist directory (a directory with audio/video files)
* Play a Youtube playlist
* Play a Soundcloud playlist
* Play a Shoutcast/Icecast/Radionomy stream
* Play a remote audio file/stream
* Let your users play Youtube videos or Soundcloud tracks
  * Similar to Plug.DJ
  * Wait List and DJ Booth (with optional roles)
* Like and Dislikes (more dislikes than likes = auto-skip)
* Smart Song History
* Smart Information
* One voice connection for each server at the same time (this feature is a courtesy of [qeled](https://github.com/qeled)'s wizardry)
* Flexible configuration
* Open Source
* Developer API (can be integrated with other bots and have addons)
